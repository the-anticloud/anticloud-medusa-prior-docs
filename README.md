# MEDUSA_PRIOR_DOCS

**Category:** CLOTHING_RETAIL
**Status:** Active development with Anticloud overlay

## What This Project Does

MEDUSA_PRIOR_DOCS is an open-source project in the CLOTHING_RETAIL category.

This project provides tools, libraries, and functionality for developers
and end users working in the CLOTHING_RETAIL domain. It is part of the
Anticloud ecosystem, which adds measured performance improvements,
security hardening, and comprehensive documentation to upstream
open-source projects.

The project addresses key challenges in CLOTHING_RETAIL by providing:

- A well-tested, community-driven codebase
- Standard interfaces compatible with the broader ecosystem
- Documentation and examples for common use cases
- Integration points for the Anticloud overlay improvements

The default location is typically:

- **Linux/macOS:** ~/.config/medusa-prior-docs/config.yaml
- **Windows:** %APPDATA%\medusa-prior-docs\config.yaml

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| log_level | string | info | Logging verbosity |
| output_dir | string | ./output | Output directory |
| max_workers | int | 4 | Maximum worker threads |
| timeout | int | 30 | Operation timeout (seconds) |

### Environment Variables

## Benchmarks

Benchmark results are recorded in BENCH.json.

Measurements were taken on the upstream codebase with the
Anticloud overlay applied. Key metrics include:

- **Build time** - Time to compile from source
- **Binary size** - Compiled artifact size
- **Runtime performance** - Execution speed benchmarks
- **Memory usage** - Peak and average memory consumption
- **Test coverage** - Percentage of code covered by tests

All measurements are reproducible and verified against the
pinned upstream commit.
